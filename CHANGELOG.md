Comment Boss 1.0Î²(1) 2017-05-21
Initial beta release.
Using Swift 3.


### Ideas for behavior changes:

* When the comment is deemed to start too close to the end of the line, yank it and put it on the previous line.
    See: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CodeBeautifying
* Handle all lines in a selection, probably looping from the last to the first to not screw up line indexing too badly when inserting new lines. If a line contains a comment, handle it. Otherwise move on.
* Default to using Xcode's Page Guide at Column setting.
    This is accessible via terminal command:
        $> defaults read com.apple.dt.Xcode.plist | grep DVTTextPageGuideLocation
    Or programmatically:
        if let defaults = UserDefaults.init(suiteName: "com.apple.dt.Xcode.plist") {
            let guideLocation = defaults.integer(forKey: "DVTTextPageGuideLocation")
        }
    NOTE: This may be blocked by App Sandbox. Possibly needs entitlement to read ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dt.Xcode.plist.
