Comment Boss 1.0Î²(1) 2017-05-21
Initial beta release.
Using Swift 3.


### Ideas for behavior changes:

* When the comment is deemed to be too close to the end of the line, yank it and put it on the previous line.

* Handle all lines in a selection, probably looping from the last to the first to not screw up line indexing too badly when inserting new lines. If a line contains a comment, handle it. Otherwise move on.
